## Effective technical discussion
There are a few ways that you can quickly get into effective technical discussions

### 1. GitHub and Markdown
Github: is a place to create source control code and also share the code with other people. Has a lot of collaborative features.
This is a great way to build out technical repeatable discussions because not only do i give people the preview here and they can see actually the Markdown in some repo.
I could use this raw markdown and put it into another source like a book or website.
It is probably the ideal technical discussion format

### 2. Gist
Gist: is a way of sharing a small code snippet. it is part of GitHub
#### You can embed the gist in your website
#### You can share the gist link
Gist example: [my code] (https://gist.github.com/ClaudeIshimwe/f913ec3828f6c2f7e89588d657d6e9a4) 
What's nice about this is that it's an isolated piece of code that i can share with other people, and many communication tools like Slack will auto render out what's in this gist.

If you are going to share code with somebody, it's a lot better to use something like a gist because then they get the exact syntax highlighting, they get the exact format, and you don't have to worry about introducing weird characters that could cause problems. This is a reproducible code sample plus people can comment on your code as well.

### 3. Colab and Jupyter
