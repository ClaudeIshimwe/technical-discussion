## Effective technical discussion
There are a few ways that you can quickly get into effective technical discussions

### 1. GitHub and Markdown
Github: is a place to create source control code and also share the code with other people. Has a lot of collaborative features.
This is a great way to build out technical repeatable discussions because not only do i give people the preview here and they can see actually the Markdown in some repo.
I could use this raw markdown and put it into another source like a book or website.
It is probably the ideal technical discussion format

### 2. Gist
Gist: is a way of sharing a small code snippet. it is part of GitHub
