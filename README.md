## Effective technical discussion
There are a few ways that you can quickly get into effective technical discussions

### 1. GitHub and Markdown
Github: is a place to create source control code and also share the code with other people. Has a lot of collaborative features.
This is a great way to build out technical repeatable discussions because not only do i give people the preview here and they can see actually the Markdown in some repo.
I could use this raw markdown and put it into another source like a book or website.
It is probably the ideal technical discussion format

### 2. Gist
Gist: is a way of sharing a small code snippet. it is part of GitHub
#### You can embed the gist in your website
#### You can share the gist link
Gist example: [my code] (https://gist.github.com/ClaudeIshimwe/f913ec3828f6c2f7e89588d657d6e9a4) 
What's nice about this is that it's an isolated piece of code that i can share with other people, and many communication tools like Slack will auto render out what's in this gist.

If you are going to share code with somebody, it's a lot better to use something like a gist because then they get the exact syntax highlighting, they get the exact format, and you don't have to worry about introducing weird characters that could cause problems. This is a reproducible code sample plus people can comment on your code as well.

### 3. Colab and Jupyter
Collab: hosted version of jupyter notebook that's available from Google.
You can run code in the notebook

I can also get access to a GPU. So if i wanted to go here and say change runtime, i could pick up a GPU or a specialised chip like a TPU

There are somme really cool features that are available in the hosted version of jupyter (collab).

Examples of documentation that i would use collab for include;
* Data Science Project.

The core idea here is that i can actually build out these examples that are collapsible, build out some code, whatever it is i want to write here, even put pictures and other itemms outside of here, and it uses markdown as well.

If i wanted to share it with someone, i could click on this icon here and just create a link and then share it with anybody. You treat it as a google doc.

You can also save the file inside Gitbhub itself.

One of the most effective ways to do a technical discussion, is to create a Colab notebook and check it into Github.

I can reference the notebook
